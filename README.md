# oais-du-jour
Keep track of the OAIS consulation from the DPC via Twitter

Tweets, as ever, sent via CRON task through my Pythonanywhere.com account. 

##Limitations

The URLs recorded here: https://github.com/exponential-decay/oais-du-jour/blob/master/wiki-uris-manual.txt

Have been created by hand by walking through the website. We need these URLs to
distinguish between general DPC content on the wiki vs. OAIS commentary. 

We can improve the situation by lobbying for an OAIS namespace to be created
on the wiki, and then potentially namespaces for other initiatives, e.g PREMIS.

**NB** Discussion URIs are monitored by appending Talk: to each page title
